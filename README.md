# HomeBookkeeping
I created this little project to improve my skills in WinForms and PorstgesSQL.
This project creates two reports: Incomes and Expenses.
Incomes have 4 data entry fields: Data, Salary, Real estate rental income and Other incomes
Expenses have 7 data entry fields: Data, Food, Transport, Mobile connection, Internet, Entertainment and Other
Also there is a function to show statistics about incomes or expenses.
